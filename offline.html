				<h3>
					Offline
				</h3>
				<p>Offline is the condition of being capable of but currently not connected to a network of
					 computers or other devices. The term is frequently used to describe someone who has the 
					 ability to be connected to the Internet but who is not currently connected to it.</p>
					 <h3>How to Use the Offline Technologies</h3>
<p>In this section, we'll look at some common problems developers face. The solutions are somewhat speculative, 
	given that most of these technologies are new and in some case, not even implemented yet! Nevertheless, 
	applications like GMail have been using some aspects of these technologies for several years 
	(as well as the earlier Google Gears plugin), and so we can suggest some meaningful rules of thumb.</p>

<h4>Storing miscellaneous data</h4>
<p>All things being equal, Web Storage should be your default port of call for storing offline data. 
	It's a dead-simple API and one that's widely supported. Only consider using the other techniques 
	if you have a specialised requirement not satisfied by Web Storage.</p>

<h4>Extracting binary resources</h4>
<p>You will sometimes want to extract binary data from a server so it can be retained locally. 
	You can download binary files very easily with data type improvements made to XMLHttpRequest</p>

<h4>Storing binary data</h4>
<p>You can store binary data directly or you can convert it to plain text. For direct binary storage, 
	you can either use a Web SQL Database with a column of "BLOB" type or the File Writer API. Alternatively, 
	you can convert the binary content to plain text using a binary encoding technique. The obvious choice is 
	Base 64, since that's the format commonly used on the net and in HTML5, e.g. it's supported by browsers 
	via data: URIs. When you come read back your base64-encoded content, you'll find you can include it in 
	your web app using a data URI, e.g. image.src = "data:image/jpg;base64," + base64data.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, base64 encoding can be quite slow, so use the techniques described in the next section to ensure 
	the system stays responsive to user events. Alternatively, it might be worthwhile exposing base64-encoded 
	representations right on your server, so your app can download them and directly store them. It will take 
	up a little more space, to the tune of around 30%, but the UI will run faster.</p>

<h4>Ensuring the Application Runs Smoothly</h4>
<p>When dealing with large amounts of data, there's a risk your JavaScript will get so busy processing data, 
	it won't devote any time to the user interface. JavaScript is fundamentally single-threaded, meaning that 
	only one thing happens at a time. If the user clicks a button, for instance, and the system is engaged in 
	a long data activity, the click event will linger on a queue for several seconds and the user will be dismayed.
	 Even longer delays will likely lead to the browser opening a dialog box asking the user if they want to stop
	  the script. Best avoided.</p>

<p>Assuming you can't (or don't want to) reduce the amount of data you're storing, the most important thing you 
	can do is exploit asynchronous APIs. With these APIs, the browser will automatically create a new thread for
	 you, do the work, and then return results back to the main thread. While the other thread is doing the work,
	  your user-interface will keep chugging along nicely in the main thread. If you've made XMLHttpRequest before,
	   you'll already know that it's almost always used in asynchronous mode, so you should do that for any Ajax 
	   calls. As for storage, most but not all of the APIs have asynchronous modes. LocalStorage is the exception; 
	   it's only synchronous, so large quantities of data I/O may slow things down. Web SQL Database, IndexedDB,
	    and File Writer all have both synchronous and asynchronous modes. You should generally favour asynchronous 
	    mode, even if it makes the programming model more complex.</p>

<p>The other way to do things asynchronously is to use WebWorkers, a way to introduce new threads into your
	 JavaScript, with your own code running in the derivative thread. However, there are some major limitations;
	  the storage APIs generally won't work inside a Worker thread, and messages passed in and out of Workers can 
	  take a long time; I've found transferring several MB to and from a worker will take several seconds and
	   lock up the user interface. So only use WebWorkers if you can't achieve the same thing with an aysnchronous
	    storage call. The situation will improve as more browsers support SharedWorkers, which have less limitations
	     (though more complexity for the developer to deal with).</p>

<h4>Handling simultaneous data opertations</h4>
<p>It was noted that Web Storage doesn't support transactions, so if you're using it, you have three choices:
	 prevent multiple clients, use locking, design around it, or hope for the best! The last choice is certainly 
	 viable, but not for robust web apps. The first choice has been attempted many times, with various tricks
	  used to constrain an app to a single window, but somehow goes against the grain of the web. Locking is
	   more feasible and hopefully libraries will evolve to support this pattern. Designing around it is also
	    possible, as evidenced by various "NOSQL" frameworks for server-side applications and elsewhere. 
	    For example, in some circumstances, you might be able to just keep appending info instead of 
	    replacing it (and periodically removing old data).</p>

<p>A simpler solution, in many cases, will be to use transactions, as supported by Web SQL Database and 
	(in the future) IndexedDB.</p>

<h4>Storing large amounts of data</h4>
<p>If you are looking to store many Megabytes - or more, beware that there are limits in place, which are 
	handled in different ways depending on the browser and the particular API we're talking about. 
	In most cases, there is a magic number of 5MB. For Application Cache and the various offline stores, 
	there will be no problem if your domain stores under 5MB. When you go above that, various things can 
	happen: (a) it won't work; (b) the browser will request the user for more space; (c) 
	the browser will check for special configuration (as with the "unlimited_storage" permission in the 
	Chrome extension manifest). In the case of Chrome, extensions can request certain permissions, including
	 "unlimited_storage".</p>

<h4>Detecting if you're online</h4>
<p>There's an HTML5 API to let you query if a browser is online: navigator.onLine(). It works on recent IE, 
	Firefox, Opera, and Chrome. You can also listen for these online/offline events using 
	document.body.addEventListener("online", function () {...} and document.body.addEventListener
	("offline", function () {...}.</p>

<p>You should generally assume the network is present and make calls as normal. It's only in the event of a server 
	timeout or related error that you should invoke navigator.onLine. Doing so will serve two purposes: (a) 
	you can decide if the error is caused by a network outage versus a server-specific outage, and if it's a
	 network outage, inform the user so they can get back online; (b) you can start watching for the "online" event,
	  and take action when the user's back online.</p>

<h4>Structuring file data</h4>
<p>The Filsystem API is designed for this use case. However, it is currently not supported everywhere. 
Alternatives include IndexedDB and Web SQL Database, which support structured data and queries against 
those structures. The general guideline would be to use one of those if you're in need of complex queries. 
But what if you need to store file data? You can use the BLOB type of Web SQL Database, but it's not intended
 for very large data items and it won't work on all browsers.</p>

<h4>Ensuring cross-browser compatibility</h4>
<p>As you've probably noticed by now, storage support varies widely across the different browsers. If that's 
true for the latest versions of each browser, imagine the differences that arise when you consider older 
versions too. To handle this, you're best off creating - or reusing - a common storage abstraction, with calls 
such as store.save(id, data) and store.findByIDs(). An example of an open-source abstraction like this is 
persist-js. An abstraction should determine which storage APIs are available (possibly using the Modernizr API)
 and then access the store using that API. This will help keep your library portable.</p>

<h4>Protecting against lost data</h4>
<p>Offline data is best used for caching content, rather than being the primary placeholder for user content. 
Browsers generally let users delete local storage, and there's a strong risk some users will do so without
 realising the consequences. Thus, ensure data is frequently sync'd to the server, preferably in an automated 
 fashion.</p>

<h4>Securing offline data</h4>
<p>As Nicholas Zakas has pointed out, a risk with offline storage is that users sometimes share the same browser. 
This may not be true with mobile browsers, but it's certainly true in many family homes and scarily more true 
in the case of internet cafes. There's a big risk of sensitive data being available to other users. They may 
not even be malicious users; they might just visit the site as someone else, only to find all of the previous 
user's locally stored data in front of them.</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>A good compromise may be to use the LocalStorage variant, SessionStorage, which deletes data when the window is 
closed. However, even this is not guaranteed to happen when a user leaves, and sessionStorage partly defeats the
 purpose of offline storage anyway. Zakas proposes encrypting any sensitive data before storing it locally, 
 though it remains to be seen if this will become a common practice among developers. There's a counter-argument 
 that users can encrypt their own file system separately (as happens with many corporate systems), and that users 
 who leave other data on their hard drive, e.g. cookies and regular data files, are already at significant risk.</p>

<p>For now, use offline storage for caching public data and perhaps other data of a general nature,
 e.g. an e-book the user has paid to download. For more sensitive data, you should consider the usage context
  and the nature of the data; sometimes it will make sense to store offline, sometimes not.</p>
